Design the Low-Level Design (LLD) for an ATM system. The system should allow users to perform essential banking transactions such as  **balance inquiries** ,  **deposits** ,  **withdrawals** , and  **fund transfers** . The design should include entities like  **User** ,  **Account** ,  **ATM** ,  **Bank** ,  **Card** , and **Transaction** to ensure modularity and scalability. Define relationships between these entities and consider enums for transaction types, account statuses, and transaction statuses. Provide methods for user authentication, transaction processing, and account management.

**The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that guide developers in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
These principles apply to object-oriented design, but they can be adapted to JavaScript as well, especially when dealing with classes and modules.**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open Close Principle**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**


By adhering to the **SOLID** principles, you create software that is:

1. **Easier to maintain** – Each class or module has a focused purpose.
2. **Easier to extend** – New functionality can be added without modifying existing code.
3. **Easier to refactor** – Code changes in one place won’t have unexpected effects elsewhere.
4. **More testable** – Since responsibilities are decoupled, you can test each part in isolation.

These principles, when applied effectively in JavaScript, help improve code quality and maintainability over time.

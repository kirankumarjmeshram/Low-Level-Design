## Introduction

This repository is intended to be a go-to resource for individuals who want to understand core object-oriented programming concepts, learn low-level design approaches, and practice common interview questions. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or simply brushing up on design patterns, this repo will provide structured examples, in-depth explanations, and plenty of exercises.

Each folder represents a core area of focus (OOP, LLD, Design Patterns, etc.), with markdown files (`.md`) for explanations and `.java` or `.py` files for coding examples.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The **OOP** section covers all major pillars of object-oriented programming with easy-to-understand examples, including:

* **Encapsulation** : Understanding data hiding and access modifiers.
* **Inheritance** : How one class can inherit properties from another.
* **Polymorphism** : Both compile-time and runtime polymorphism explained.
* **Abstraction** : Defining abstract classes and interfaces.
* **SOLID Principles** : A detailed breakdown of the five SOLID principles to help you write better code.

Each concept is explained with a markdown file for theory and a corresponding code example to demonstrate its real-world application.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

This section walks you through the design of various system components with a focus on real-world use cases. Topics include:

* **Designing an Elevator System** : Concepts like state management, scheduling algorithms, and modularity.
* **Parking Lot Design** : Handling vehicles, ticketing, and payments with an OOP approach.
* **Splitwise System Design** : Breaking down a bill-sharing application.
* **BookMyShow Design** : Ticket reservation and seat booking systems.

Each problem has a detailed markdown explanation, followed by a code implementation that shows how the design principles and OOP concepts are applied.

## Design Patterns

The **Design Patterns** section covers the three main types of design patterns, with code examples and explanations:

1. **Creational Patterns** :

* Singleton
* Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

1. **Structural Patterns** :

* Adapter
* Composite
* Proxy
* Decorator

1. **Behavioral Patterns** :

* Observer
* Strategy
* Command
* Chain of Responsibility

These patterns are essential for low-level design, and understanding them is critical for system design interviews.

## Interview Questions

The **Interview Questions** section provides a collection of common questions that interviewers may ask during technical interviews. The section is divided into:

* **OOP Interview Questions** : Questions to assess understanding of OOP principles and applications.
* **LLD Interview Questions** : Questions focusing on low-level system design scenarios.
* **Design Patterns Interview Questions** : Commonly asked questions about implementing and recognizing design patterns.
* **Behavioral Questions** : Non-technical questions that assess problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and communication skills.

Each question comes with a detailed solution to help you understand the underlying concepts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request with a description of the changes you've made.
